# github Finder 
### a small application that allows you to search for any regestired github user using pure javascript with no framwork
#### the main purpose i've made this one is to practice how to deal with external API which is github and how to use asynchronous programming (ajax) to fetch user input and display it in the UI
#### NOTE: to use this application all you need is to regitser in this link below:
####: https://github.com/settings/developers then create new OAuth App to get your own client id and secet key (it's simple...)
####: for the UI: i used this boostrap theme : https://bootswatch.com/lux/
####: Happy Coding !
